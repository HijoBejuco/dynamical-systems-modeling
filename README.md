### Two dimensional discrete dynamical systems
In this kind of systems, there is a **function** that takes 2 numbers as input, and returns two numbers as outputs. Note that this is not the same as two separate functions. The process should be seen as one multi input and multi-output function. The output for y depends not just on the input of y but also on the input of x.

* If a one dimensional dynamical system gives us an scalar in R1, a two dimensional system gives us a point in R2 --> (x, y)

#### The HÃ©non map
Functions are also commonly refered as **maps** by mathematicians, so map = function. 

$$
\begin{align*}
x_{n+1} &= y_n + 1 - a x_n^2 , \\
y_{n+1} &= b x_n ,
\end{align*}
$$
